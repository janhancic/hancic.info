						<p class="lead">The above is my moto, both in my professional and personal life. I believe that if I keep working on my skills, bit by bit, I will succeed.</p>
						<p>I was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia (where I still live) in 1986. It was quite a while before I got my first computer (just at the start of high school) but, boy was it love at first sight. I immediately started to wonder how all this magic works and, more importantly, how could I make the computer do magic.</p>
						<p>First there was Basic, then Visual Basic with which I started creating computer "viruses" (programs that would run maximized without the close button). After much fiddling around I discovered Front Page and was fascinated that you could put buttons on a HTML page. The only problem was that I didn't know how to make them do anything. Which lead me to discover PHP which I still use to this day (and yes, I actually like it).</p>
						<p>During the first summer vacation in high school I worked at my first job. At first I was mostly goofing around, but after reading many books I got to work on some serious projects. With new projects I had to learn new languages (C#, Java, ...) and tons of other technologies. I will be forever grateful to my former boss (and ex-future father in law) for giving me the opportunity to work for his company.</p>
						<p>While working at that company and going to school I also did some freelance work, which produced some very (and some not so very) successful projects. After 7 years of working for the same company and doing freelance work, I decided to move on. I dedicated all of my time to my current employer, where we are making some of the most interesting and challenging projects in Slovenia.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>If you read all that and would like to get in touch (either to exchange ideas or offer me a project to work on), feel free to contact me <small>(contact information is on the top of this page)</small>.</p>
