We had an awesome [Hackday](http://blog.caplin.com/2014/11/10/hackday-6-hack-o-ween-roundup/) at [Caplin](http://www.caplin.com) a couple of weeks ago. My team built, in 24 hours, something very special: augmented reality table tennis. I've written a blog post summarising how we did it on our company blog. You can read it [here](http://blog.caplin.com/2014/11/13/augmented-reality-table-tennis/). Or, if you don't feel like reading, you can watch a video of it [here](http://vimeo.com/111113027).
