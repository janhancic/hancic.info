I often have problems keeping up with the huge amount of comments on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/news "Hacker News") submissions, so I developed a simple Google Chrome extension that shows which comments are new. It works on individual items and on the "threads" page.

You can install the extension from the [Google Chrome extensions page](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fpndmkcfggkffpablcooicmihgcgalil "HN Unread comments").

I've also decided to put the code on GitHub so feel free to fork and improve the extension. You'll see that it's really simple, only 39 lines of code including comments at this point. See the project [here](http://github.com/janhancic/hn-unread-comments "HN Unread Comments on GitHub").

Please let me know if there are any bugs or if you have suggestions on how to improve the extension.
