You are looking at a new design for this page. The old one was really, well ... old. And it gave me a perfect opportunity to play around with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). I must say that I like this bootstrap thing a whole lot. It's really amazing when you see what you can come up with in ridiculous small amounts of time. And if you are brain dead as far as design goes (like me) it really can help you build some amazing stuff.

I'm pretty happy with how this redesign turned out, there are still some details to iron out, but I'll get to those when I have the time. But do please let me know if you find anything out of place. The code (not the word press version) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/janhancic/hancic.info) if you'd like to have a look.
