I've decided to open a [GitHub](http://github.com/) [account](http://github.com/janhancic "Jan Hančič on GitHub") so I can keep track on what's happening with my favourite projects. I've also decided to create some projects of my own there. So here it is my first GitHub repository: [Chrome badge animator](http://github.com/janhancic/chrome-badge-animator). It's just a simple JavaScript class you can use if you are building Chrome extensions. I have already [posted about it](/badge-animator-for-chrome-extensions) some time ago. Nothing special, just something to get me started with this social coding thing.

Off course I'm planning on adding more projects in the future (I think I have one or two laying around) and I hope that this will encourage me to start something new and release it to the wild.
