I was in the office almost all day this past Sunday. Many people asked me: "why"? Here is my answer: I love what I do, I don't consider my work as a job but something I do because I enjoy it. The fact that I'm living off of it is just a bonus.

It never ceases to amaze me, how almost nobody I know, outside of my colleagues,  likes what he is doing.
