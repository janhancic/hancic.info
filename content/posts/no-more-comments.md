![no more spam](/post_images/spam.jpg)I've decided to disable new comments on this blog. To be honest I just got feed up with all the SPAM that was coming through the Akismet filters and I haven't seen a legitimate comment in months (which is a bit sad, but entirely my fault since I haven't been writing all that much lately).

I would receive at least one email from my blog telling me to review a new comment and it was always SPAM (and that got annoying rather quickly). Akismet served me well for a long time, but it looks like it has lost the battle. And I just can't be bothered to spend time searching/implementing a better solution. Like I said, I haven't seen a legitimate comment in months, so why bother?

If you would like to give me feedback on the stuff I write just use [twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@janhancic), or [contact me](/about) through other means. I'll leave it to the big guys to fight spam.
