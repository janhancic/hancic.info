I don't really get the whole new year thing. Everybody is talking about change and good wishes and what not, but I don't see how anything will change just because of a simple date increment. I guess humanity needs this artificial mile stones to reflect on what has been done and what has happened. Having said that, today probably is a day, as good as any, to look back and think a little.
Since I like bullet points I'll use those to list what I've done in 2009 (in no particular order):

- I finally took some time to actually learn something about JavaScript and I feel in love with it, [jQuery](http://jquery.com) has probably helped here a lot and I can't imagine how the internet worked without this beautiful language in the past.
- I improved my knowledge of [PHP](http://www.php.net), written a brand new framework with which I'm happy with (for now), it even got some praise from someone I worked with for a short while.
- Like with JavaScript above, I took the time to improve my HTML&CSS skills and that worked out quite well. These three things are so easy that nobody actually learns them but just pick up on them as he goes along. Luckily I realized this is a mistake and I am still working on improving my skills in this area.
- I started reading technical blogs and web pages again. I learned a lot from other (smarter) people this way.
- I used [memcache](http://memcached.org/) on a couple of our projects, great technology.
- I learned [Comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) and developed [chat](http://www.igre123.com/chat) with it, hackish stuff Comet, but the future is looking bright on the real-time-web front.
- I've started to actively participate on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (see my badge on the left) again. It's a great way to brush up on your skills and give something back to the community.
- I've started to write here on this page again which is a great way to, hopefully, give back something to the community.
- I went to my first conference ( [PHP Konferenca](/php-konferenca-2009))
- I had my [first lecture](/my-lecture-at-webcampljubljana-video) at [WebCampLjubljana](http://webcamp.si/), and that was a great experience and I hope I'll have a chance to do it again sometime.
- I was given a task to find another programmer for our company and although that didn't quite [work out in the end](http://swizec.com/blog/lost-a-freelance-project-but-gained-a-knowledge/swizec/932), I gained a lot of experience from that process.
- We launched a brand new web page ( [spored.tv](http://www.spored.tv)), redid another one from scratch ( [mojalbum.com](http://www.mojalbum.com)) and cloned a couple of others ( [igre123.rs](http://www.igre123.rs), [mojnet.rs](http://www.mojnet.rs)). It's always great to work on something completely new and, like I said, I had the pleasure to develop two brand new web pages in one year.
- I've lost a [customer](http://www.pozareport.si) for reasons I don't quite understand which has hurt me financially but all is well.
- [I've developed](/aliiike-recommendation-engine) a system that uses the [Aliiike recommendation engine](http://aliiike.com/)
- I've written so many lines of code that I've forgotten half the stuff I did this year :)

There is probably some more stuff that I can't remember right now, I'll edit if I remember something else.
And here is what I'd like to do/improve in the next year:

- I'd like to play with the technologies that are behind the [NoSQL movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL).
- I will introduce a versioning software to our company (yes I know, shame on me).
- I will set-up a wiki where I will try to document as much as possible.
- I will try to get some more break from my work as to avoid burning out.
- I will improve my PHP/JavaScript/HTML/CSS/whatever else I'm using skills.
- I would like to learn a new programming language.
- I will work on my people skills and try to bring my arrogance down for just a notch :)

Again there is probably something I've forgotten to put on that list.

All in all as far as my professional life/career goes this was a successful year. I won't talk about my personal life here, but I will say that it kinda sucked. That is all.
