I will have a lecture next weekend at [WebCampLjubljana](http://webcamp.si/). I will be lecturing about [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), a better way of writing CSS. I don't know at what time my lecture will be so come and stay the whole day, there will be tons of [other great lectures](http://webcamp.si/predavanja/).

I am a little bit nervous since this will be my first talk before about 100 people and in English to top it off (and my English, as you can read, is not all that good). Well I hope I see you there.
