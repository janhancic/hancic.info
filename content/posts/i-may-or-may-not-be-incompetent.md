By I, I mean we, and by we, I mean me and my boss. And by me and my boss, I mean everybody who manages other people or their experiences of whatever sort.
For example, you walk into a groceries store and immediately see 10 things that are just wrong or plain old stupid. And you think: "if I ran this I'd be so much better". For instance, I would open the second (and the third), cash register when there are 20 people queuing behind one that is open (and operated by an old lady whose source of joy, it seems, is making other people wait indefinitely).

And then there is me, co-managing [many](http://www.mojvideo.com "Mojvideo - prva slovenska video skupnost") [online](http://www.igre123.com "Igre123 - največja slovenska igralnica") [communities](http://www.mojalbum.com "mojalbum") thinking that all is well and fair. But there are still countless people complaining constantly about this and that.

So, either I'm a incompetent fool, or they are. The catch is that I simply don't know.
When I'm in my "customers" shoes, everybody else is incompetent. And when I'm the boss of my "customers" it seems, to me, that they are the fools (dear customer, if you read this: I love you).

I see no way of resolving this right now. So, sadly, no advice here, just food for thought.
