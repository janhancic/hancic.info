I haven't posted here in a while. But I have written two blog posts for my [company's](http://www.caplin.com) [blog](http://blog.caplin.com). The first one is about me attending a London JS classes lecture, where I learned how to use JavaScript to control an Arduino. You can read it [here](http://blog.caplin.com/2014/03/28/using-javascript-to-program-an-arduino/).

The other one was published more recently, and talks about using git bisect and a product we make, [BladeRunnerJS](http://bladerunnerjs.org/). Read it [here](http://blog.caplin.com/2014/07/31/find-bugs-automatically-with-git-and-bladerunnerjs/).
