As I've mentioned in my previous post, I had a lecture about [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) at [WebCampLjubljana](http://webcamp.si/) in November. Guys that put the whole thing together now [published the videos](http://video.kiberpipa.org/wclj.html) (every lecture was recorded) and here is my lecture:

[Sass – a better way to write CSS](http://vimeo.com/8453105) from [Jan Hančič](http://vimeo.com/user2883167) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

It was my first time doing something like this, so I was a wee nervous but I think it doesn't show (except that I used "amm" as every second word). Since this was also my first \*Camp, I also didn't quite know what the target audience will be, and I think (as some have pointed out) I was a little bit to technical. I should have probably focused more on describing the benefits of Sass and how it can speed up your development, not how to actually use it.
But I hope somebody will find some use of it now that is floating around the internet.
