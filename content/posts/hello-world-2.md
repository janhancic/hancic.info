This is my fourth first blog post. I had my old page here before (which you can see [here](/old)). Now there is this one, and knowing me this will probably the only thing written here for a long time. Unless, of course, it won't be. I shall see. And this "new" page is not a result of some new year's resolution. That would be silly.

Anyway, in the meantime you can see what I have [done](/?page_id=3) and who I [am](/?page_id=2).
