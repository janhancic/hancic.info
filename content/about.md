My name is Jan Hančič and this is my little corner of the world wide web. By profession I'm a
software engineer. In my personal life things are a bit less certain; who I am changes yearly, which
is exactly how I like it. However, there are a few things that I hope never change. I am a father to
my exceptional daughter, partner to my amazing companion and I'm a vegan.

This website started as a technology blog where I wrote about programming only. I'm now trying to
use this website to capture thoughts and opinions on a more varied and wide set of things. Only
things I wouldn't mind shouting about in a park corner, however. The rest goes into my personal
diary.
