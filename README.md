Source code for my personal website https://hancic.info

## Development

This is a static website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

All dependencies are obtained with the `./get_deps.sh` script which will download all the
necessary binaries into the `bin` folder inside the repo folder. The website is meant to
be built using these binaries as they are pinned to a specific version.
